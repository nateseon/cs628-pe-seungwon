#Input
The project began with structuring and styling the resume content. In the input stage, details such as name, contact information, education, skills, projects, and work experience were written and organized. These details were added to the resume.js file as components, enabling React to process them. Additionally, the React app was initialized using simple commands like npm and npx.

#Process
React's component-based architecture was used to break down the input data into distinct sections, such as Education, Skills, and Projects. Each section was organized into reusable components for efficient rendering. Styling was handled in the resume.css file, which was customized to align with personal branding. React's efficiency and modularity allowed for a structured and maintainable approach to building the application.

#Output
The final output is a professional, web-based resume rendered in the browser. This resume can be easily shared via a URL, making it accessible to potential employers or collaborators. The project demonstrated React's versatility and provided a modern platform for showcasing my skills and experience effectively.
