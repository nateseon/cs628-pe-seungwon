Input
The program includes a movies variable in MovieList.js, which contains a list of favorite movies with details like title, genre, and release year. Users provide input through a dropdown menu to filter movies by genre and by clicking on a movie to trigger events.

Process
The program uses React state to manage the movie list and selected genre. A filtered list of movies is generated dynamically based on the selected genre. If "All Genres" is selected, all movies are displayed. When a user clicks on a movie, an event triggers to display its details in an alert.

Output
Filtered or complete movie lists are rendered dynamically in MovieList.js, styled via App.css, and displayed through the main App.js.
