Input The Recipe Finder application allows users to input recipe details, including the name, ingredients, and instructions, through a form in the AddRecipe component. Users interact with the form by entering the required information and submitting it. The application relies on React's useState hook to manage form inputs dynamically.

Process The App.js component serves as the central hub, integrating other components such as AddRecipe, RecipeList, and RecipeDetails. The application requires react-router-dom for routing, enabling navigation between different views. It utilizes Router, Route, Routes, and Link to manage page transitions. The useNavigate hook ensures that after adding or editing a recipe, the user is automatically redirected to the Recipe List. The useParams hook is used to retrieve the selected recipe’s details dynamically. Additionally, the application uses styled-components for consistent styling across different buttons and form elements.

Output Upon successful submission, the new recipe is added to the list and displayed in the Recipe List view. Clicking on a recipe name navigates to its detailed view, showing the recipe’s ingredients and instructions while maintaining the overall app layout. Users can also edit or delete recipes directly from the RecipeDetails component, with changes reflected in the Recipe List view. The application maintains a seamless and user-friendly experience throughout the process.
