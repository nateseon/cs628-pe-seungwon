Input
The Cities application allows users to input city details, including the name, country, and population, through a form in the AddCity component. Users interact with the form by entering the required information and submitting it. The application relies on React's useState hook to manage form inputs dynamically.

Process
The App.js component serves as the central hub, integrating other components such as AddCity, CitiesList, and CityDetail. The application requires react-router-dom for routing, enabling navigation between different views. It utilizes Router, Route, Routes, and Link to manage page transitions. The useNavigate hook ensures that after adding a city, the user is automatically redirected to the Cities List. The useParams hook is used to retrieve the selected city’s details dynamically.

Output
Upon successful submission, the new city is added to the list and displayed in the Cities List view. Clicking on a city name navigates to its detailed view, showing the city’s country and population while maintaining the overall app layout.
